== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Problem

The role of a team manager is to initiate, plan, design, execute and monitor the project to achieve its intended outcomes. This means the team manager must be able to efficiently organise and record down many details of the project to fulfill their responsibilities. However recording project details on pen and paper or word documents is too time consuming and lack many features that can aid in project management, such as deadline reminders.

== Target user profile

* has a need to manage complex projects
* leader of the team
* team manager
* prefer desktop apps over other types and prefer typing over mouse input
* is comfortable using CLI apps


== Value proposition
Team Manager software is an application that helps you to better collaborate,
communicate, and, ultimately, manage a group of people. Team Manager is created
to increase productivity and improve the quality of work a team produces.

The Team Manager application will enable the team manager to efficiently plan tasks, save time, and assign proper amount of tasks to team members, while providing an intuitive gui for them to visualise and easily keep track of the team progress.
Users can use this app to manage projects faster than a typical mouse/gui driven app.

== Design
=== Architecture
image::SoftwareArchitecture.png[]

1. The program enters from TeamManager(currently implemented as core.Duke)
2. The `Software` consists of 3 main components: `UI` `Logic` `Model`
3. The `UI` component holds the responsibility of gui and console ui
4. The `Logic` component holds the responsibility of running business logic e.g manipulating the `Model`
5. The `Model` exposes the software's data object models, including methods for manipulation
6. The `Storage` component utilises gson to parse the data into a json format, which is easy to edit and maintain
7. The Json data files are persistent and open for user editing.

=== UI component
=== Logic component
image::LogicDiagram.png[]

1. `LogicController` uses the `NewParser` class to parse the user command.
2. NewParser parses the commands and returns the correct command to be called
3. Command takes from an `abstract` command class, following the command design pattern
4. Each command must implement a execute method, where a `CommandOutput` is returned
5. `CommandOuput` contains the string output to user, which is what the user sees, and flags such as the exit flag
6. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicController`.
7. The command execution talks to `Model` and do some behavior to get desired result and return it back.
8. The command execution talks to `Storage` (if necessary, e.g. adding a member) throw `Model` (e.g. a save() method in `Model` API).
9. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandOutput` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram interactions within the Logic component for the execute("delete task 1") call.

image::Logic_delete.png[width="939", align="left"]

=== Model component
image::ModelDiagram.png[]
1. The `Model` component uses an interface `Model` to expose the api, while the actual implementation is in `ModelController`
2. This allows for the implementation of the model to change without affecting the rest of the code(UI & Logic)
3. The `Model Controller` calls two main data managers: `TasksManager` & `MemberManager`
4. These two data managers handles the manipulation of the two data objects, `Task` & `Member`
5. The fields associated with each data model is described in `Task` & `Manager`

=== Storage component
1. The `Storage` component imports the gson library provided by google to perform serializing
2. The `Save` method in `Storage` serializes the java objects into a json string before using a file IO to write to persistent storage
3. The `Load` method in `Storage` uses a file IO to load the data into a string, before deserializing according to the original java object shape
4. This method allows for easy maintenance, where we do not need to modify the parser(for storage) to accommodate for date model changes
5. This methods also allows for easy editing by the user as it is stored in a json notation text file.

=== Common

1. Classes used by multiple components are in the `common` package.
2. The `Common` component contains `DukeException` and `LoggerController`.

== Implementation

=== Delete Feature
==== Implementation
The delete command is implemented in ​`DeleteTaskCommand` ​ and ​`DeleteMemCommand`​. They both extend ​`Command​`.
When user input list command from UI, it talks to Logic, Model and Storage. This action changes the App data. +
E.g `​DeleteTaskCommand` ​user input: ​delete task 1 +
The following sequence diagram shows how DeleteTaskCommand works in Logic, Model and Storage. +
We focus on the behavior inside Model.

image::Model_delete.png[width="600", align="left"]

==== Design Analysis
When a user delete a task, the tasklist of a member (the task name that the member is in charge of) should also be updated, if necessary. +
Therefore, first get the name of the task first, as we just store task name in Member. +
Then talk to `MemberManager` to delete corresponding task in every member. +
Then talk to `TaskManager` to delete task.

=== Reminder Feature
==== Implementation
The reminder command is implemented in ​ReminderCommand​, extending Command. ​
The reminder command is handled in the same manner as other commands, and new reminders are added to a specified task.
Upon creation of a new reminder, a refresh is called in the ReminderController. A refresh is also called upon deletion of a task and starting of the program. +
Any current sleeping thread is interrupted and disposed. The Reminder Controller then searches for the earliest Reminder. A new thread is invoked and the thread is slept until the time of the reminder. +
Upon waking, it calls for the ReminderController to display the reminder, and another refresh is called. +
The following is the sequence diagram of the normal operation of the Reminders System.

image::Reminders.png[width="939", align="left"]

Upon invocation of the refresh function, if the earliest reminder has passed, the reminder is immediate displayed as a missed reminder and another refresh is called.


=== Input History Feature
==== Implementation
Each line of input typed by the user is passed to the ​InputMemory.​ Each line is added to an ​ArrayList​ of strings, and sets a pointer to the last item. Up and down arrow keys will shift this pointer along the ArrayList and retrieved previously typed inputs and sets it into the input field.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Problem

The role of a team manager is to initiate, plan, design, execute and monitor the project to achieve its intended outcomes. This means the team manager must be able to efficiently organise and record down many details of the project to fulfill their responsibilities. However recording project details on pen and paper or word documents is too time consuming and lack many features that can aid in project management, such as deadline reminders.

== Target user profile

* has a need to manage complex projects
* leader of the team
* team manager
* prefer desktop apps over other types and prefer typing over mouse input
* is comfortable using CLI apps


== Value proposition
The Team Manager application will enable the team manager to efficiently plan tasks, save time, and assign proper amount of tasks to team members, while providing an intuitive gui for them to visualise and easily keep track of the team progress.
Users can use this app to manage projects faster than a typical mouse/gui driven app.

== Design
=== Architecture
=== UI component
=== Logic component

API: No Interface for now

1. `LogicController` uses the `NewParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicController`.
3. The command execution talks to `Model` and do some behavior to get desired result and return it back.
4. The command execution talks to `Storage` (if necessary, e.g. adding a member) throw `Model` (e.g. a save() method in `Model` API).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandOutput` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram interactions within the Logic component for the execute("delete task 1") call.

=== Model component
=== Storage component
=== Common

== Implementation

=== Delete Feature
==== Implementation
The delete command is implemented in ​`DeleteTaskCommand` ​ and ​`DeleteMemCommand`​. They both extend ​`Command​`.
When user input list command from UI, it talks to Logic, Model and Storage. This action changes the App data. +
E.g `​DeleteTaskCommand` ​user input: ​delete task 1 +
The following sequence diagram shows how DeleteTaskCommand works in Logic, Model and Storage. +
We focus on the behavior inside Model.

==== Design Analysis
When a user delete a task, the tasklist of a member (the task name that the member is in charge of) should also be updated, if necessary. +
Therefore, first get the name of the task first, as we just store task name in Member. +
Then talk to `MemberManager` to delete corresponding task in every member. +
Then talk to `TaskManager` to delete task.

=== Reminder Feature
==== Proposed Implementation
The reminder command implemented in ​ReminderCommand​, extending Command. ​
The reminder command passes through the usual route of handling commands,
then passes the information over to the ​ReminderManager.​
Reminders are then created based on the task index and timing given.
The ReminderManager runs a thread in the background,
and sleeps until the time of the next reminder to alert the user of the reminder.

=== Input History Feature
==== Implementation
Each line of input typed by the user is passed to the ​InputMemory.​ Each line is added to an ​ArrayList​ of strings, and sets a pointer to the last item. Up and down arrow keys will shift this pointer along the ArrayList and retrieved previously typed inputs and sets it into the input field.

== Introduction

Team Manager is a schedule handler application for team managers
with very packed schedules who prefer to use a desktop app for managing *tasks*, *members* and *reminders*. +
The Team Manager personal assistant application will enable team managers to *efficiently and seamlessly plan their schedules*,
*assign tasks to proper members*, as well as *providing visual cues for deadlines and reminders*. +
Team Manager is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)*
while providing an intuitive GUI for them to visualise and easily keep track of their busy schedules.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `.jar release` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `Team Manager`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The gui should appear in a few seconds.

+
. Once the GUI appears you will be brought to a front page (dashboard) where you can get started on creating your own schedule.
. There are 4 main components in the dashboard.
* `Upper Left` Progress display. Gives a representation of overall progress
* `Lower Left` CLI output. Feedback for each command entered will output here
* `Upper Right` Task/Member display. Shows tasks and members and their assignments. Views can be switched.
* `Lower Right` Command box. Enter input here. Use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through previous inputs.
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will list the command you can use.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list tasks` : lists all tasks
* `add task complete event banners /at 12/12/2019 1000` : adds a task to the list
* `done 1` : marks the 1st task shown in the current list as done
* `delete task 1` : removes the 1st task shown in the current list
* `bye` : exits the app
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in parenthesis means optional, depends on the previous choice

* Words in *UPPER_CASE* are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `delete INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 1`.
* Items in square brackets means can have space e.g `add todo [TASK_NAME]` can be used as `add todo read book`.
* Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times (>=1) e.g. [PREREQUISITE TASK(s) index]…​ can be used as `1`, `1 2`, `1 2 3` etc.
* DateTime has to be of pattern “dd/MM/yyyy HHmm” or "dd/MM/yyyy"
* There are roughly three parts of commands, dealing with tasks, members, and some commands combining them together.

== Introduction

Team Manager is a schedule handler application for team managers
with very packed schedules who prefer to use a desktop app for managing *tasks*, *members* and *reminders*. +
The Team Manager personal assistant application will enable team managers to *efficiently and seamlessly plan their schedules*,
*assign tasks to proper members*, as well as *providing visual cues for deadlines and reminders*. +
Team Manager is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)*
while providing an intuitive GUI for them to visualise and easily keep track of their busy schedules.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `duke.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `Team Manager`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The gui should appear in a few seconds.

+
. Once the GUI appears you will be brought to a front page (dashboard) where you can get started on creating your own schedule.
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will list the command you can use.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list tasks` : lists all tasks: todo, deadlines and events
* `add deadline complete event banners /by 12/12/2019 1000` : adds a deadline to the list
* `done 1` : marks the 1st task shown in the current list as done
* `delete 1` : removes the 1st task shown in the current list
* `bye` : exits the app
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
